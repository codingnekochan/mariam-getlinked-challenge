# getlinked-challenge- Participant ReadME

Hello fellow coders! I'm excited to be participating in the Get-Linked.ai coding challenge, and I want to share my journey and progress with you through this README. Here's how I'm approaching the challenge:

# My Approach

# Understanding the Challenge

The first step in any challenge is to gain a solid understanding of the requirements. In this challenge, we are tasked with building a user interface (UI) that interacts with an API. The specifics of the UI and API endpoints are provided in the challenge details. I've carefully reviewed the challenge description to ensure I'm clear on what's expected.

# Setting Up the Environment

I've set up my development environment to get started. I will be using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AstroJs/Tailwind.

# User Interactions

Depending on the challenge requirements, I'm adding interactive features to the UI. This might include buttons, forms, filters, or any other elements that allow users to interact with the data or perform actions.

# Testing and Debugging

As I build both the UI and API integration, I'm rigorously testing my code. I'm using browser developer tools, console logs, and testing different scenarios to ensure that everything works as expected. If any issues arise, I'm debugging and refining my code until it functions correctly.

# Version Control

I'm using Git for version control, committing my code regularly, and providing meaningful commit messages. This helps me track my progress and changes.

# Submission

Once I've completed the challenge to my satisfaction and thoroughly tested it, I'll push my code to my GitHub repository. I will be deploying my code via netlify and submitting the links to my repository and web page via the submission link provided

# Conclusion

Participating in a UI and API challenge like this is an excellent opportunity to showcase my skills in web development and API consumption. I'm excited to take on the challenge and demonstrate my ability to create a seamless user experience while interacting with external data sources.

To my fellow participants, best of luck! Let's rise to the challenge and impress the Get-Linked.ai team. Happy coding!
